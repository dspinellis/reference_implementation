# Epidose: A privacy-preserving epidemic dosimeter based on contact tracing

This repository provides an open source software
reference implementation for an _epidemic dosimeter_.
Just as a [radiation dosimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimeter)
measures dose uptake of external ionizing
radiation, the epidemic dosimeter tracks potential exposure to viruses
or bacteria associated with an epidemic.
The dosimeter measures a person's exposure to an epidemic, such as COVID-19,
based on exposure to contacts that have been tested positive.
The epidemic dosimeter is designed to be widely accessible
and to safeguard privacy.
Specifically, it is designed to run on the $10 open-hardware
[Raspberry Pi Zero-W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)
computer, with a minimal user interface, comprising LED indicators
regarding operation and exposure risk
and a physical interlock switch to allow the release of contact data.
The software is based on the [DP3T](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents)
contact tracing "unlinkable" design and corresponding reference implementation
code, gratefully acknowledging the team's amazing work.

## Rationale
Contact tracing via smartphone apps has been widely touted as an important
way to control and limit the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.
However, basing contact-tracing on phone apps has several limitations.
[According to market reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetration),
while in higher income countries smartphone penetration is over 60%, in
lower income ones it drops significantly, even to less than 20%.
Even in higher income countries, smartphone penetration declines significantly
with [increased age](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCE.2016.2614524)
and reduced income.
Also, Bluetooth-based contact tracing apps may not be able to run on
older smartphone models, and many fear compromised privacy when running
such an app on their phone.
Contact tracing app solutions benefit only those using them by flagging
at an early stage one at risk.
Therefore, older people who are usually less accustomed to technology
(and also run greater risks) and less privileged society members are
at a disadvantage.

Exposure tracking solutions can only be successful if adopted by a
significant percentage of the population.
In lower income regions and countries
(which could be
[devastated by COVID-19](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/03/26/the-coronavirus-could-devastate-poor-countries)),
smartphone-based solutions are unlikely to be effective due to a lack
of critical mass.
The proposed epidemic dosimeter addresses the above limitations.

Given its low cost and simplicity (a single LED indicator),
the epidemic dosimeter can be easily and affordably deployed to
lower income countries and marginalized parts of a population
serving billions.
Its resemblance to existing diagnostic devices,
and the ability to distribute it without exchanging documentation
can also allay the fears of those who worry about the privacy implications
of phone apps.
By extension, its existence will also increase the acceptance
of comparable phone apps.

## Overview and Use

<img width="300" alt="Epidemic dosimeter concept drawing" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eellak/epidose/master/epidose/hardware/concept.svg">

<img width="300" alt="Epidemic dosimeter prototype box" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eellak/epidose/master/epidose/hardware/box.svg">

The epidemic dosimeter is a lightweight (<100g), low-cost
(mass-produced <40â‚¬), self-contained device, housed in a package with a
three-color LED.
One simply picks it up from a distribution point without
providing any personal data, charges it, and carries it around.
When health authorities test people, they associate its contacts with the
test results by attaching the dosimeter to a special beacon.

### Dosimeter status indicator LED

* Heartbeat (double) flashing green: Normal isolated operation
* Green flashes: other exposure notification devices are being detected
* Orange flashes: other exposure notification devices are close
* Slow flashing red: User may have been exposed and should contact a
  health provider.
* Rapidly flashing red: User has been tested positive and needs to self
  quarantine. (To be used in areas lacking better means to contact people.)

### Power indicator LED
* Off: Device is operating on batter
* Orange: Charging is required.
* Green: Device is being charged

### Status indicator LED after pressing the WiFi button
* Constant (3 seconds) lighting green: obtained network connection
* Constant (3 seconds) lighting orange: no WPS network found in the area
* Constant (3 seconds) lighting red: failed to connect to a network

The dosimeter can last more than a full working day without charging.

As a possible extension the LED indicator can be extended to more
LEDs to indicate:

* the level of exposure, and
* by tracking other encountered Bluetooth devices, the effectiveness
  of the user's social distancing measures.

## Technology
The epidemic dosimeter works by acting as a
[Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy)
(BLE) beacon to transmit periodically-changing random identifiers,
and as a corresponding beacon receiver to track individuals carrying
a dosimeter located in the vicinity.
By basing its code on the DP3T reference implementation it should also
interoperate with the corresponding smartphone applications.
The dosimeter's design calls for it to be pre-configured to
obtain possibly infected contacts and software updates through a
global WiFi sharing network, such as that offered by [fon](https://fon.com/).

## Software architecture
The dosimeter's software is designed around the following components,
as depicted in the diagram at the end of this section.

* `beacon_tx_unlinkable_d.py`: Continuously running transmitter of ephemeral
  identifiers.
  Each day a new set of identifiers are created, stored in a database,
  and transmitted.  Every 15 minutes the transmitted identifier changes.
  Each day the transmitter also purges from the database ephemeral
  identifiers that no longer need to be retained.
* `beacon_rx_unlinkable_d.py`: Continuously running receiver of
  identifiers transmitted by other devices.
  These are again stored in a database in hashed format to allow
  the identification of contacts with infected persons.
  Each day the received also purges from the database received hashes
  that no longer need to be retained.
* `create_filter.py`: A program that is run on the server.
  It takes as input epoch identifiers and ephemeral identification hashes
  and produces a [Cuckoo filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_filter)
  that can be used to check for possible contacts with infected persons.
* `check_infection_risk.py`: A program that is run on the
  epidemic dosimeter.
  It takes as input the Cuckoo filter, and calculates
  the number of infected contacts found in the database.
  The application updates the indicator LED according to the result.
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database for storing the
  created and received ephemeral identifiers.
* `update_filter_d.sh`: A continuously running script that downloads
  from the server the Cuckoo filter for the identifiers of infected contacts,
  and checks whether the device's user is affected or not.
* `upload_seeds.py`: Subject to an agreement between the user and
  the health authority, implemented through a physical interlock and
  a suitable protocol, this uploads to a health authority's server the
  seeds used for transmitting ephemeral ids of a user found to be infected,
  using a supplied key.
* `upload_seeds_d.sh`: Continuously waits for user authorization to
  upload an affected user's ephemeral id seeds to the Health Authority.
* `watchdog_d.py`: Monitors the correct operation of all components and
  flashes the green LED to indicate correct operation.
  It also resets the device in case of a failure.
* `update_client.sh`: Runs periodically to download an updated filter,
  check for contacts with infected persons, and perform any required
  software updates.
* `ha_server.py`: The health authority's server, which receives
  lists of infected person's contacts and provides filter updates.
* A device running in testing centers acts as a user interface and
  source of trust.  It allows health professionals, in coordination
  with the epidemic dosimeter's user, handle the uploading of its
  contacts (at that point, or when the test results are out),
  providing a single-use key to authorize and authenticate the upload.
* `shutdown_epidose`: Performs a graceful shutdown and removes power from
  the device in order e.g. to ship it.  From the command line, run
  `sudo /opt/venvs/epidose/bin/shutdown_epidose.sh -i` in order to
  perform this shutdown.
  Note that for this to work the device must be running on battery,
  with no external power being provided.
* `wps_scanner_d.sh`: Supports WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) to obtain
  a network connection by using the push button configuration (PBC).
  It always tries to connect to the network with the strongest signal.
  If a network connection is obtained, it kills the sleep process of
  update_filter_d.sh to force it to update the cuckoo filter.

![Software architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eellak/epidose/master/doc/software-architecture.svg?sanitize=1)

## Hardware
The device consists of three boards: a Rasberry Pi Zero-W, sandwiched between
a [controller board](https://github.com/eellak/epidose/blob/master/epidose/hardware/circuit/controller.pdf)
that controls power and provides a real-time clock, and an
[interface board](https://github.com/eellak/epidose/blob/master/epidose/hardware/circuit/interface.pdf)
that provides the LEDs, switches, and the USB charging port.

Instructions for building an earlier, prototype, device can be found [here](https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200520/).


### Controller board

### Interface board

![interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eellak/epidose/master/epidose/hardware/circuit/interface.png)


## What is implemented
Currently all the device-end functionality has been implemented and
tested, with a device reporting an _infected_ status after (manually)
downloading a filter constructed from identifiers actually transmitted
and received over Bluetooth.

The following programs are available in the `epidose` directory.

* `device/beacon_tx_unlinkable_d.py`
* `device/beacon_rx_unlinkable_d.py`
* `device/check_infection_risk.py`
* `device/upload_seeds.py`
* `device/update_filter_d.sh`
* `device/upload_seeds_d.sh`
* `back-end/create_filter.py`
* `back-end/ha_server.py`

All programs can be run with a _--help_ argument to obtain usage information.

## What is missing
The server and the device automation and configuration are under construction.
Our aim is to automate their configuration with suitable
[Puppet](https://puppet.com/) scripts.

In some places the code takes shortcuts or makes simplifications (e.g.
not using the number of messages and their strength (RSSI) for estimating
the infection risk.)  These are marked in the code with `TODO` comments.

Also missing are the following.

* The health authority user interface and upload key protocol
* The design for 3D-printing the enclosure

## Installing the reference implementation

Currently, there are two ways of installing the reference implementation.
You may install it on an existing Raspbian system or create a new image.
The two alternatives are presented below.

### Install on an existing system

You'll need to install the required libraries and project.
Here is how you can do it under the Ubuntu GNU/Linux distribution.

```bash
sudo apt-get install git libbluetooth-dev libglib2.0-dev python3-dev python3-setuptools shellcheck sqlite3 virtualenv dh-virtualenv debhelper supervisor
git clone https://github.com/eellak/epidose
cd epidose
virtualenv venv -p /usr/bin/python3
. venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -e .
```

### Create a new image

You'll need to download a vanilla Raspbian distribution (Lite version is suggested for this purpose)
and burn it on a microSD card.
Then perform the following steps on your microSD card while it is mounted on your workstation.

* [Enable the SSH daemon](https://howtoraspberrypi.com/how-to-raspberry-pi-headless-setup/) by creating an empty file in the boot directory (of the image) named as "ssh" (without any extension) 
* Allow the device to connect to your network by creating a "wpa_supplicant.conf" file in the boot directory (of the image) with the following content:
```bash
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=Initials of your country's code, e.g., GR

network={
	ssid="The name of your WiFi network"
	psk="The password of your WiFi network"
}
```
* Move the microSD card from your workstation to the Raspberry-Pi and start the device

Then execute the following steps after obtaining an SSH connection
to your Raspberry-Pi.
To find the device's IP address, check your router's or access point's
status or logs.

* [Create an authorized keys file](https://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/)
to connect to the device as user `pi` using a private key.
This step is required so that you can be able to login later,
once the `pi` user is replaced by the `epidose` user.

* Update the operating system.
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
* Install the following packages on your Raspberry-Pi device.
```sh
sudo apt-get install git ansible
```
* Execute the following commands.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/eellak/epidose
cd epidose/epidose/device
```
* Execute the Ansible script by providing the relevant command-line arguments (see [section](#Ansible))
```sh
sudo ansible-playbook install_and_configure.yml --tags "production|development" --extra-vars "eduroam_network_psk=password_of_the_epidose_eduroam_account epidose_backup_network_psk=password_of_the_epidose_backup_wifi"
cd /home/epidose/epidose/epidose/device
sudo ansible-playbook install_and_configure.yml --tags "delete"
```

* After executing this step, you will be able to login as user `epidose` with
the private key you established previously for logging in as user `pi`.
Moreover, after executing the _delete_ tag of Ansible,
the default `pi` user will be deleted.
Therefore, you can only login as user `epidose`.

* To apply the configuration changes, you will need to reboot the device.
First, you need to `exit` from the current `ssh` connection,
then login as user `epidose`, and execute the reboot command in the terminal.
```sh
exit
ssh epidose@IP_address_of_your_device
sudo reboot
```

### Ansible Tags And Extra Variables

The _delete_ tag remoces the default _pi_ user
and it does not require any command-line arguments.
To install and prepare the environment to run the epidose,
the tag _production_ should be used.
In case you are willing to help the development team of epidose,
execute the Ansible script using the _development_ tag.
The tag _development_ also runs the epidose software.
In the case of _production_ and _development_,
all the defined _extra-vars_ are mandatory run epidose.

_extra-vars_
* password_of_the_epidose_eduroam_account is the password of the
  Eduroam account set up for Epidose.
* password_of_the_epidose_backup_wifi is the password of the Epidose SSID
  network.

## Running the client code

After downloading the project and setting up the development dependencies
(see below), you can run the client code on a Raspberry-Pi Zero-W as follows.

```sh
make package
sudo make install
```

You can then monitor the device's operation with the following commands:

```sh
tail -F /var/log/beacon_tx
tail -F /var/log/beacon_rx
tail -F /var/log/upload_seeds
tail -F /var/log/update_filter
```

You can also obtain a report of what has been stored in the device's
database by running `utils/client-db-report.sh`.

## Running the back-end Health Authority server code

After downloading the project you can run the health authority server code
on a (hopefully) more powerful Raspberry-Pi host as follows.

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/epidose
sudo venv/bin/gunicorn epidose.back_end.ha_server:app --daemon --pid=/run/ha_server.pid --access-logfile=/var/log/ha_server_access_log --disable-redirect-access-to-syslog --error-logfile=/var/log/ha_server_error_log --capture-output --bind=0.0.0.0:5010
```

You can then monitor the server's operation with
`tail -F /var/log/ha_server_error_log` and
`tail -F /var/log/ha_server_access_log`.


To install the `ha-server` through the Ansible script execute the following steps
on the machine you like to deploy it.
The step below will also install and configure an Nginx server
for the `ha-server`.

```sh
sudo apt install git ansible
git clone https://github.com/eellak/epidose
cd epidose/epidose/back_end
sudo ansible-playbook deploy.yml --extra-vars "server_name=hostname_of_server"
```

The *server_name* can be the domain name you have bought (e.g., epidose.ellak.gr)
After executing the above script, the `ha-server` should be up and running.


## End-to-end operation

With the client and server running, you can run an end-to-end
contact tracing scenario between an affected user and a user who
is at risk, as follows.
The example below assumes that the Health Authority server has a DNS
record named `ha-server`.

### On affected user's device
To upload the past half-hour ephemeral id seeds to the
health authority server press the device button is pressed to signify
the user's consent.
Normally, this will happen
after the Health Authority provides to the user's device an upload key
and information regarding the period of several days
over which the user was affected (rather than half-hour).

If you don't have a device with a physical button you can instead
run the following command.
```sh
sudo venv/bin/python epidose/device/upload_seeds.py -d -v -s http://ha-server:5010/ $(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S' --date='30 min ago') $(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
```

### On the Health Authority server
Run the following command to create a new Cuckoo filter,
which will include the contacts of the affected user.

```sh
sudo venv/bin/python epidose/back_end/create_filter.py -v -d /var/lib/epidose/filter.bin
```

### On user's at risk device
Wait for at most six hours for the Cuckoo filter to be updated.
Alternatively,
run the following command to download the new Cuckoo filter and
check for matching contacts.

```sh
sudo epidose/device/update_filter_d.sh -l ha-server:5010
```

The filter is updated every six hours.
To force the downloading of a new filter,
remove the downloaded filter (`sudo rm /var/lib/epidose/client-filter.bin`)
and rerun the `update_filter_d.py` script.

```


### Update user's device
Apart form fetching the Cuckoo filter,
the device will also fetch shell scripts from
the health authority server to update the device.
The update scripts can update the Epidose software, the kernel,
the microcontrollers' firmware, etc.
By default the update script should be an empty file.
An update script that updates the Epidose daemons could be as follows.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Go the local repository
cd /home/epidose/epidose

# Pull the latest changes from the remote production branch
git pull origin production

# Change pulled files owner and group from root to epidose
git ls-files | xargs chown epidose:epidose

cp -r epidose dp3t /opt/venvs/epidose/lib/python3.7/site-packages/
cp epidose/device/shutdown_epidose.sh \
	epidose/device/upload_seeds_d.sh \
	epidose/device/update_filter_d.sh \
	epidose/device/util.sh \
	epidose/device/wps_scanner_d.sh /opt/venvs/epidose/bin/

# Reboot to apply changes and restart all epidose daemons
reboot
```

In the above case the device is rebooted after obtaining
the new Epidose updates in order to restart the Epidose daemons.
If the update filter is not affected by an update one could
restart selective daemons by running *supervisorctl* with appropriate
arguments.



### Update server's URL
To update the server's URL where the epidose device
fetchs the filters and updates, modify the the URLs
of the *update_filter*, *upload_seed*, and *wps_scanner*
daemons from the *epidose/device/supervisord.conf* file.
After commiting the changes add an update.sh file
on the previous server link (not the newly add server URL),
to update the devices.
An update script to change the server's URL can be as follows.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Go the local repository
cd /home/epidose/epidose

# Pull the latest changes from the remote production branch
git pull origin production

# Change pulled files owner and group from root to epidose
git ls-files | xargs chown epidose:epidose

# Copy the supervisord configs the update daemons server URL
cp epidose/device/supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/epidose.conf

# Reboot to apply changes
reboot
```


An update script for testing installed images before deployment
could be as follows.
Through this, (given an appropriate WiFi setup)
testing a new board involves observing the heartbeat
and then observing the green steady LED.
After the green LED turns off the device is also turned and is ready
for shipping.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

touch /tmp/pre-update

# No updates on development boards
test -f /tmp/development && exit

# Allow watchdog to run for 5'
sleep 300

# Turn on green LED for 5'
cd /home/epidose/epidose
supervisorctl stop epidose:watchdog
venv/bin/python epidose/device/device_io.py -G
sleep 301

touch /tmp/post-update

# Turn off device
/opt/venvs/epidose/bin/shutdown_epidose.sh -i
```

## Development

For development, you should install the development and test dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -e ".[dev,test,deploy]"
```

You should also install the proper pre-commit-hooks so that the files stay
formatted:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

It's a good idea to clone and regularly integrate the DP-3T
reference implementation, which is the base of this code's cryptographic
protocol.

```sh
git remote add dp3t https://github.com/DP-3T/reference_implementation.git
git fetch
```

To login into a production device over WiFi, follow these steps.
* Press the WPS button to establish a WiFi connection
* ssh to the device as epidose with the private key provided to you
* Terminate the daemon that will turn off the WiFi connection by running
  `sudo supervisorctl stop epidose:update_filter`
* Terminate the pre-deployment update script, if this is running, to avoid
  having the machine turned off.
* Run `touch /tmp/development` to sidestep remote updates
  (unless you want to test them).

### Running the tests

To run the tests, simply call

```sh
pytest
```

If you just installed the test dependencies, you may need to reload the `venv`
(`deactivate` followed by `source venv/bin/ativate`) to ensure that the paths
are picked up correctly.

### Packaging
Run `make package` to create a package for distribution.

### Deployment
Run  `sudo make install` to deploy the package.

### Deployment refresh
After the first deployment, source code files can be deployed by
running `sudo make fast-install`.

### Program monitoring and restarting
* Run `sudo supervisorctl status` to see the running programs
* Edit `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/epidose.conf` to change program parameters
* Run `sudo supervisorctl reload` to read changed program parameters
* Run `sudo supervisorctl restart` _progam name_` to restart new program
  version.
